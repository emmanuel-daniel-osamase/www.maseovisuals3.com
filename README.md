# Portfolio | Graphics & Web Design

Welcome to my official design portfolio! This repository hosts the source code and optimized assets for my personal showcase website.

## 🚀 About the Project
This site is designed to showcase my visual work, ranging from high-end graphic design to interactive web layouts. After moving away from platforms with strict usage limits, I have rebuilt this version to be high-performance and lightweight.

## 🛠️ Optimization Features
To ensure a smooth user experience without hitting bandwidth caps, I have implemented:
* **WebP Images:** All static graphics and photos were converted to WebP for superior compression and quality.
* **WebM Video:** High-resolution video backgrounds have been converted to WebM format to reduce file sizes by over 60%.
* **Mobile-First Design:** Fully responsive layouts that work on any device.
* **Video Fallbacks:** Implemented HTML5 fallback logic to ensure videos load correctly on all modern browsers.

## 🎨 Design Services
* **Graphic Design:** Branding, Logo Design, and Print Media.
* **Web Design:** UI/UX Design, Responsive Landing Pages, and Portfolio Layouts.
* **Motion Graphics:** High-quality video assets and animations.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `/index.html` - The main entry point of the site.
* `/assets` - Contains all optimized WebP/WebM media files.
* `/css` - Custom styling and animations.
